<h1 align="center">Mr. Dear</h1>

I'm here to help you manage your sites on [Oh Dear! App](https://ohdear.app) by chat. Also I can text you if something is going wrong (Let's hope it'll be no need to ðŸ˜‰)

## Documentation

### Sites

- `/sites` - I'll show you a list with your current sites and their most recent status result.
- `/newsite` - We will begin a delightful conversation in order to add a new site to your collection.
- `/removesite` - Okey, I get it, you don't want to see that site anymore, but first we will confirm you really want to do this.
- `/site {url|id}` - I'll be glad to show you all the information regarding to a specific site.

### WIP

The rest of the commands are work in progress.
