<h1 align="center">Mr. Dear</h1>

I'm here to help you manage your sites on [Oh Dear! App](https://ohdear.app) by chat. Also I can text you if something is going wrong (Let's hope it'll be no need to ðŸ˜‰)

## Commands

- `/sites` - I'll show you a list with your current sites and their most recent status result.
- `/newsite {url}` - We will begin a delightful conversation in order to add a new site to your collection.
- `/deletesite {url or id}` - I get it, you don't want to see that site anymore, but first we will confirm you really want to do this.
- `/site {url or id}` - I'll be glad to show you all the information regarding to a specific site.
- `/downtime {url or id}` - Let's see how many times your site was down for the last month.
- `/uptime {url or id}` - I'll tell you the percentage your site was up on the last month.
- `/brokenlinks {url or id}` - Check out your website's broken links in a second.
- `/mixedcontent {url or id}` - Check out your website's mixed content.

## Action Buttons

Since the moment you ask me about your sites (`/sites`) I'll show you the name of your sites along with
an indicator to see quickly if it's online (âœ… or ðŸ”´) in form of a button. You can click it to see more 
information about your site and another group of buttons to check other common actions like Broken Links,
Downtime, etc...
